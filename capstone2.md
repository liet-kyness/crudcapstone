1: Stack will be a React UI, node/express backend, and linked
    to a PostgreSQL database.

2: Full-stack web application will be the goal; however the
    front-end UI will likely get more attention than the
    back-end

3: I would like for this to be a mobile app for my employees to use,
    but this course hasn't taught us anything about creating them.
     So web app.

4: My application would improve prductivity at work, since everyone
    is on their phones constantly anyway. Beyond that, it would be an
    all-in-one catalog of current tasks that need to be completed, along
    with recipes for each item.

5: I suppose as long as the database was updated, any kitchen
    manager or chef could use this application; however, I would
    personally start with my own restaurant. Like agile but for 
    kitchens?

6: The data I plan on using would incorporate recipes from a user-
    created API that can be updated with CRUD operations.

7: a) Database schema out of the box would just be a list of prep
    items, along with each ingredient and a brief description
    of the preparation method. However, in the future, supposing
    a recipe were to include an ingredient that is itself another
    recipe (i.e. lobster stock would have its own recipe, but also be
    used in lobster bisque and lobster veloute), the relationships
    would become more complex.

    b) I don't forsee any issues moving forward with this?
    c) The only sensitive information I would need to secure would be 
     login information, as I would only want current employees to
     be able to access the data.

    d) CRUD operations for updating recipes, a todo (prep) list
        for employees to complete, login/logout to access the content.
